		<h2>E-1 Strategy Guide</h2>
		<i>Admiral, abyssal forces have invaded the southwestern seas once again, cutting us off from vital locations in the area.<br>
		Use a Combined Fleet to eliminate their presence.<br>
		<ul>
		<li>LBAS is available for use on this map.</li>
		<li>You may sortie either a Carrier Task Force or a Surface Task Force to this map.</li>
		<li>Be sure to thoroughly clear the area before proceeding to the target.</li>
		<li>Thanks to Minhfongboy for providing difficulty scaling and the home screen map icon.</li>
		</ul></i>
		E-1 is divided into two routes: North and South. The North route is accesible with a CTF, the South via a STF. Both routes must be taken in order to unlock the debuff present in the map.
		<br>
		<h3>Progression</h3>
		<h3>Part 1: Unlock the Debuff</h3>
		Particularly on Medium and Hard, the fleet at the boss node is incredibly strong and almost impossible to take down. Thankfully, a debuff is present in the map that gives you a 1.45x postcap damage 
		multiplier on all of your ships. You trigger this debuff by obtaining an S-rank at nodes S, T, and V.
		<h4>S-rank Node T</h4>
		This must be done using a Surface Task Force. Bringing 3 DD while keeping the fleet light appears to be the key to taking a shorter route. Once you get there, S-ranking this node is relatively straightforward and painless.
		<h4>S-rank Nodes S, V</h4>
		This must be done using a Carrier Task Force. The only real branching rule on the North route is from C -> H; to skip the sub node E a fast fleet with 4 or fewer BB + CV seems to be required. Node V has incredibly high airpower, 
		bringing 4CV is highly recommended, as is AACI to tolerate the mutliple air raid and air battle nodes on the way to S and V. S-ranking node S is pretty easy when you get there, node V on the other hand may take you a few tries.
		<h3>Part 2: Kill the Boss</h3>
		After unlocking the debuff, all that is left is to kill the boss. With the high postcap damage modifier you should make quick work of her assuming your fleet is loaded out appropriately. You can use either a Surface 
		Task Force or Carrier Task Force for this portion. A Fleet Oiler is needed if you wish to avoid incurring a damage penalty at the boss due to the length of the preboss on either route.

		<h2>E-2 Strategy Guide</h2>
		<i>Commander, our next objective is to reclaim MI Island from an overwhelming abyssal force in what we will call 'Operation 139'.<br>
		In preparation, secure dominance in the MR Isles by reclaiming captured transports and eliminating the enemy airbase.<br>
		After doing so, continue further into the region and investigate an anomaly that may interfere with execution of Operation 139.<br>
		Commander, we are counting on you!<br>
		<ul>
		<li>LBAS is available for use on this map.</li>
		<li>LBAS bases available for use will expand as you capture enemy airbases.</li>
		<li>Capturing transports is vital to success in the transport operation.</li>
		<li>Thanks again to Minhfongboy for creating difficulty scaling, and to Prinz Eugen-sama for providing boss assets.</li>
