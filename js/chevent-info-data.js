			<br>
			<h2>Part 1: Unlock the Debuff</h2>
			Particularly on Medium and Hard, the fleet at the boss node is incredibly strong and almost impossible to take down. Thankfully, a debuff is present in the map that gives you a 1.45x postcap damage 
			multiplier on all of your ships. You trigger this debuff by obtaining an S-rank at nodes S, T, and V.
			<h4>S-rank Node T</h4>
			This must be done using a Surface Task Force. Bringing 3 DD while keeping the fleet light appears to be the key to taking a shorter route. Once you get there, S-ranking this node is relatively straightforward and painless.
			<h4>S-rank Nodes S, V</h4>
			This must be done using a Carrier Task Force. The only real branching rule on the North route is from C -> H; to skip the sub node E a fast fleet with 4 or fewer BB + CV seems to be required. Node V has incredibly high airpower, 
			bringing 4CV is highly recommended, as is AACI to tolerate the mutliple air raid and air battle nodes on the way to S and V. S-ranking node S is pretty easy when you get there, node V on the other hand may take you a few tries.
			<h2>Part 2: Kill the Boss</h2>
			After unlocking the debuff, all that is left is to kill the boss. With the high postcap damage modifier you should make quick work of her assuming your fleet is loaded out appropriately. You can use either a Surface 
			Task Force or Carrier Task Force for this portion. A Fleet Oiler is needed if you wish to avoid incurring a damage penalty at the boss due to the length of the preboss on either route.`

			strategyText:`E-2 is a three-phase map: Transporting supplies to the general airbase area, securing control of said airbase, and investigating the anomaly taking place past it.
			<h2>Part 1: Clearing the Transport Phase</h2>
			You will immediately recognize that something odd is going on with the transport phase with one peek at the gauge - an incredible 4000 TP on Hard difficulty. There is a map mechanic present which gives you 
			a multliplier for the TP you earn, which is the key to clearing this phase in a timely manner. To take advantage of it, you must use a Transport Combined Fleet and S-rank node F and/or L. Each node S-ranked gives an additional 
			1.5x multiplier for TP earned during the sortie you S-rank it, meaning you can have up to a 4x TP multiplier in the most optimal case. Routing to these nodes requires that you bring many ships carrying transport items (drums, daihatsu) 
			and that you keep your fleet light (battleships and carriers aren't treated kindly by the routing).
			The boss node W is a relatively straightforward installation boss. Utilize your LBAA, WG42, and Type 3 Shells to consistantly secure A-ranks and clear the TP phase with ease!
			<h2>Part 2: Claiming the Airbase</h2>
			The second part of the map tasks you with throwing more firepower at the airfield sitting in W and conquer it once and for all. You can use the same TCF that you did during the first phase, but it will be far more 
			difficult than taking advantage of the Striking Force Fleet option avaiable for this portion. You can bring some battleships and carriers and still take an ideal route, but in the end you still need to bring lighter ships (light cruisers, destroyers) 
			to secure the best branching. Like in the first phase, good LBAA, WG42, and Type 3 Shells will be very helpful in clearing this boss. Tanks will also come in handy with it comes to defeating installations enroute to the boss. 
			With an optimized setup, the boss will fall in due time.
			<h2>Part 3: Investigating the Anomaly</h2>
			After reclaming the airfield, your task is to use your advantageous position to look at an anomaly that has puzzled command for some time. To conduct your investigation, you must secure total control over the latter 
			portion of the operational area, that being closest to the anomaly. More specifically, you must accomplish the following:
			<ul>
			<li>Hard Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z6; AS+ nodes Y, Z2, Z3, Z4</li>
			<li>Medium Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z6; AS nodes Z2, Z3, Z4</li>
			<li>Easy Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z6; AS nodes Z2, Z4</li>
			<li>Casual Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z6</li>
			</ul>
			Using a fleet with many carriers is the key to securing the air raids. Approaching the harbor at node Y is best done using a smaller fleet. When these requirements are met, the boss will be unlocked.
			<h2>Part 4: Elminating the Anomaly</h2>
			Now that the anomaly has been identified, proceed to eliminate it! Prior to doing this, it is suggested that you trigger the debuff mechanic present for this boss. To do so:
			<ul>
			<li>Hard Difficulty: S-rank nodes W, Y, Z5, Z8</li>
			<li>Medium Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z5, Z8</li>
			<li>Easy Difficulty: S-rank nodes Y, Z5; A-rank node Z8</li>
			<li>Casual Difficulty: S-rank node Y, A-rank node Z8</li>
			</ul>
			Use fleets from the earlier parts to effectively defeat the listed nodes. After unlocking the debuff, enemies at the boss receive an armor debuff, and Friend Fleets will arrive at the boss node.
			For routing to the boss, utilize a Surface Task Force with a limited number of heavy ships and at least one Seaplane Tender to secure the most ideal route. LHA can shorten the route taken, but not quite to the 
			extent that AV can. The boss node is packed full of installation-types that are weak to Type 3 Shells, bringing them is essentially mandatory for clearing. PT Imps are also present at the boss node; equipment that is 
			effective against them should be brought with you to counter them. The use of special attacks is advised, as the boss can prove difficult even with the debuff active.`,

			Before starting on the final boss, eliminate the enemy's boss support by completing the below requirement:
			<ul>
			<li><b>A-rank (Casual/Easy) or S-rank (Medium/Hard) node Z2 (once on Casual/Easy/Medium, twice on Hard):</b> [CTF] 3CV(B) 1CVL 2XX + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)) [Fast Fleet]. Pick node Z2 from the choice node W. Only 1 CLT can be brought to this node.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Part 3.2: Defeat the Princess Occupying the MH Isles!</h2>
			Use the enhanced vision granted by Surface Radars and Skilled Lookouts to see the fleet to victory!<br>
			<b>Sample Composition:</b> [CTF] 3CV(B) 1CVL 2XX + 1CL 2DD 3XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)) [Fast Fleet]. Pick node Z3 from the choice node W. This Abyssal Princess has a specially-designed torpedo bulge, and resists any attacks from ships wielding torpedos; as such, using torpedos is not advised against this enemy.

			The MH Isles are now firmly in the grasp of our forces. Congratulations on the hard work, Admiral. Now we can advance---<br>
			…<br>
			...ah<br>
			We have just received a request for assistance from our forces near the Solomon Isles, stating that a massive Abyssal formation has suddenly appeared and that they need help in countering it. 
			This, frankly, deviates from the original plan, but whatever this is must be addressed quickly, and will be the Final Operation of this conquest. 
			Work in conjunction with our forces from the Solomons to resist this formation, and work hard toward a convincing victory. 
			Finish this conquest by breaking through over the rising sun...
			<ul>
			<li>Thank you Dark Sentinel for the equipment reward cards, and Nanami for other assets!</li>
			<li>You may sortie a Single Fleet, Striking Force, or Combined Fleet to this map.</li>
			<li>Command wishes you the best of luck in completing this operation.</li>

			First of all, congratulations on making it this far. This is another very, very long map, so be patient in clearing it. The map contains nodes with identical letters that are colored differently. When referring to these nodes, 
			the node letter followed by its color in brackets will be written. If an easier clearing experience is desired, there is a debuff that can be unlocked at any time which can aid in completing the various requirements listed below:
			<ul>
			<li><b>A-rank (Casual/Easy) or S-rank(Medium/Hard) node P (once on Casual/Easy/Medium, twice on Hard):</b> Any combined fleet will route to node P during Part 1 of the map so long as node M is picked at the choice node A.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS at node D (once on Casual/Easy, twice on Medium/Hard):</b> Any Carrier Task Force will route to node D so during Part 1 of the map so long as node B is picked at the choice node A.</li>
			</ul>
			Enemy LBAS is also present on this map, this time from the first map phase onwards. It can, however, be disabled by completing another map gimmick which becomes fully available from Part 2 onwards:
			<ul>
			<li><b>Obtain AS at node N (once on Easy/Medium, twice on Hard, not required for Casual):</b> This can be done with a Carrier Task Force (during parts 1, 5), a Striking Force (all parts), or a Surface Task Force (parts 1, 2). All Combined Fleet types will always route to this node from M, whereas Striking Forces will only route here if they contain 2(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CVL 2DD.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS (Easy, Medium) or AS+ (Hard) at node C2[Red] once (not required for Casual):</b> See Part 2, Carrier Task Force Composition #2.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS (Casual, Easy, Medium) or AS+ (Hard) at node C3[Red] once:</b> 4CV(B) 1(F)BB(V) 1AV + 1CL 2DD 1CA(V) 2XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)/CA(V)) with 1/2/2/3 AIR radars.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS (Casual, Easy) or AS+ (Medium/Hard) at node D3[Red] once:</b> See C3[Red] composition.</li>
			<li><b>A-rank (Easy/Casual) or S-rank (Medium/Hard) node F[Red] (once on Casual/Easy/Medium, twice on Hard):</b> See C3[Red] composition.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS on LBAS Defense (once on Casual, twice on Easy/Medium/Hard)</b></li>
			<li><b>Obtain Perfect Defense (no damage taken) on LBAS defense (once on Medium, twice on Hard, not required for Casual/Easy)</b></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Part 1: Eliminate the Initial Threat! Defeating the Destroyer Princess at node I</h2>
			During this map phase, all fleets start at the southern starting point.
			This node contains a Battleship Re-class, Ancient Destroyer Princess, and PT Imp Pack escorting the Destroyer Princess. Send all necessary supports to deal with these escorts. Note that only the Destroyer Princess must be killed in order to complete this requirement. 
			Ships historically part of Operation Kon receive a damage bonus at node I.<br>
			<b>Surface Task Force Composition:</b> All route through the Battleship walls at nodes E and G. Plan accordingly.<br>
			<b>Carrier Task Force Composition:</b> All route through the Aircraft Carrier Princess at node J. Plan accordingly.<br>
			<b>Single Fleet/Striking Force Composition:</b> 1CV(B) 1(F)BB(V) 1CL 3/4DD [Fast Fleet] will route B-E-C-H-I. 3CV(B/L) 1CL 2/3DD will route B-D-F-J-I. Other heavier compositions will route the same as STF/CTF depending on the number of (F)BB(V) and CV(L/B) present.
			<br>
			<h2>Part 2: Visions from the Past - The Second Battle Against the Abyssal Crane Princess at node J[Red]</h2>
			It's time for another faceoff against the Abyssal Crane Princess, an Aircraft Carrier Princess, and a Battleship Princess. From this part onwards, all Carrier Task Forces will start at the northwestern starting point. Note that only the Abyssal Crane Princess must be killed in order to complete this requirement. 
			Ships that were a part of Ozawa's Fleet during Leyte Gulf receive a damage bonus at node J[Red].<br>
			<b>Carrier Task Force Composition #1:</b> 3CV(B) 2(F)BB(V) 1CA(V) + 1CL 2DD 1CA(V) 2XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)/CA(V)). One of the CV(B) must be the flagship of the main fleet. This composition routes through C1[Red], exchanging the Submarine Princesses at E2[Red] for an additional Air Raid node. 
			Be sure to bring enough LoS to pass the LoS check.<br>
			<b>Carrier Task Force Composition #2:</b> Heavier Carrier Task Forces will route through E2[Red], and have a chance of offrouting to H[Red] if more than 5 (F)BB(V)+CV(B/L) are present. Said chance of offrouting increases if a BB is flagship of the fleet.
			<br>
			<h2>Part 3: Further Anti-Submarine Patrols - Submerging the New Submarine Princess at node E[Yellow]</h2>
			A familiar foe emerges in the New Submarine Princess and her entourage of old Submarine Princesses. From this part onwards, all Surface Task Forces will start at the southeastern starting point. Note that only the New Submarine Princess must be killed in order to complete this requirement.<br>
			<b>Transport Combined Fleet Composition:</b> 1CVE 1DE 4DD + 1CL 3DD 1DE 1CA. 0/0/1/2 (Casual/Easy/Medium/Hard) DE are required for the shortest routing with this composition. A BBV can be employed, but the fleet will pass through node E enroute to E[Yellow]. Use of supports enroute are highly recommended.<br>
			<b>Surface Task Force Composition:</b> 4(F)BB(V) 1CVE 1CA(V) + 1CL 2DD 2CLT 1CA(V). CVE are the only carriers allowed if one seeks to avoid routing through node B[Yellow].<br>
			<h2>Part 4: A Final Night Battle - Eliminating the Abyssal Strait Princesses at node M[Yellow]</h2>
			Night battles make one final appearance with this boss - eliminate the Abyssal Strait Princesses to finish clearing the route to the true boss of this map! Note that only the Abyssal Strait Princesses must be killed in order to complete this requirement. Ships that were a part of Nishimura's fleet receive a damage bonus at node M[Yellow].<br>
			<b>Surface Task Force Composition #1:</b> 2(F)BB(V) 4XX + 1CL 4DD 1XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)). The flagship of the fleet must NOT be a BB, though FBB and BBV are allowed. The escort fleet must contain a Searchlight to avoid node L[Yellow].<br>
			<b>Surface Task Force Composition #2:</b> 3(F)BB(V) 3XX + 1CL 4DD 1XX (XX excludes (F)BB(V)). The flagship of the fleet must NOT be a BB, though FBB and BBV are allowed. If it is, the fleet may be offrouted to K[Yellow]. This fleet allows one to bring another (F)BB(V) and avoid a night node in exchange for fighting the Anchorage Water Demon at node H[Yellow].<br>
			<h2>Part 5: Finding a Weakness - Completing the Final Boss Debuff</h2>
			Now that the map has been cleared of princesses, it is time to complete the final map gimmick - the debuff.
			<ul>
			<li><b>S-rank node P:</b> Either bring a superheavy Single Fleet/Striking Force or a heavier Carrier Task Force with a sum of 3 SS(V) + AS. Note that S-ranks at node P performed prior to reaching Part 5 of the map do NOT count toward this requirement.</li>
			<li><b>A-rank (Casual/Easy) or S-rank (Medium/Hard) node R:</b> Either bring a Single Fleet/Striking Force with 1(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CVL 1CL 2DD or a Carrier Task Force with 2(F)BB(V) 3CV(B) 1SS + 1CL 1FBB 2DD 1AS 1SS.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS (Easy/Medium) or AS+ (Hard) at node R (not required for Casual):</b> See previous requirement.</li>
			<li><b>S-rank node S:</b> Any Single Fleet/Striking Force composition can reach this node.</li>
			<li><b>S-rank node T:</b> Any Single Fleet/Striking Force composition and some Carrier Task Forces based on the node F[Red] composition can reach this node.</li>
			<li><b>S-rank node U:</b> Most Carrier Task Forces can reach this node; see compositions in Part 6.</li>
			<li><b>Obtain AS+ at node V (once on Casual/Easy, twice on Medium/Hard):</b> Most Carrier Task Forces, most Surface Task Forces, and all Single Fleet/Striking Force compositions can reach this node; see compositions in Part 6.</li>
			<li><b>Reach node W:</b> See compositions in Part 6.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Part 6: The End of the Pacific Conquest - Sinking the Abyssal Core Sentry Mk.I</h2>
			The last boss of this large event is finally ready to be defeated. Full support is necessary to finish this map. Help guide the fleet to victory over the rising sun!<br>
			<b>Surface Task Force Route:</b> 4(F)BB(V) 1CV 1CAV + 1CL 2DD 1CLT 2CA(V)<br>
			<b>Carrier Task Force Route:</b> 4CV(B) 2(F)BB(V) + 1CL 2DD 1CLT 2CA(V)`,
